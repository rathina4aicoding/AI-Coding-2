Gnanathesikan in a\\nDalit\\nfamily in\\nPannaipuram\\n, at present-day\\nTheni district\\nin Tamil Nadu, India, on 3 June 1943.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nHe however celebrates his birthday on 2 June to honour\\nM. Karunanidhi\\nwhose birthdate also falls on 3 June. It was Karunanidhi who gave Ilaiyaraaja the title \"Isaignani\".\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\na\\n]\\nAt the time of joining school, his father, Ramasamy\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nchanged his name from Gnanathesikan\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nto \"Rajaiya\", and the people in his village called him \"Raasayya\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nWhen he joined\\nDhanraj Master\\nas a student to learn musical instruments, the master changed his name to \"Raja\". While working for his first film\\nAnnakili\\n(1976), Tamil film producer\\nPanchu Arunachalam\\nadded the prefix \"Ilaiya\" (meaning \\'younger\\' in\\nTamil\\n) to the name \"Raaja\", and renamed him as \"Ilaiyaraaja\", as in the 1970s there was another popular music director with the same suffix, namely\\nA. M. Rajah\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nInitial exposure to music\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja grew up in a\\nrural area\\nand was exposed to a range of\\nTamil folk music\\nin his formative years.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nAt the age of 14, he joined a travelling musical troupe named \"Pavalar Brothers\", headed by his elder brother\\nPavalar Varadharajan\\n, and spent the next decade performing across\\nSouth India\\n.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nWhile working with the troupe, he penned his first composition, a musical adaptation of an\\nelegy\\nwritten by the Tamil\\npoet laureate\\n,\\nKannadasan\\n, for India\\'s first prime minister\\nJawaharlal Nehru\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn the initial years he used to set tunes to the songs of his brother Pavalar Varadarajan, who was a communist in then undivided\\nCommunist Party of India\\n. He later left to\\nMadras\\n(now Chennai) along with brother Bhaskar to learn Music, they had only four-hundred rupees, which their mother procured by selling off the home radio. They knew no one in the city and were confident to live off the payments they would receive by singing for people on the streets.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nIn Madras, he became a student of\\nMaster Dhanraj\\nwho nurtured his immense potential. Remembering his master, Ilaiyaraaja said, \"My master’s tiny room was inhabited by\\nBach\\n,\\nHaydn\\n,\\nBrahms\\n,\\nMozart\\nand\\nBeethoven\\n.

K. Venkatesh\\n, he worked on 200 film projects, mostly in Kannada cinema.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nAs Venkatesh\\'s assistant, Ilaiyaraaja would\\norchestrate\\nthe melodic outlines developed by Venkatesh, and learn about composing under Venkatesh\\'s guidance. During this period, Ilaiyaraaja also began to write his own scores. To listen to his compositions, he used to persuade Venkatesh\\'s\\nsession musicians\\nto play excerpts from his scores during their leisure times.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nFilm score composer\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja at the TFPC Press Meet\\nAt the start of his career, the music sensibility of Ilaiyaraaja was very different to the film music composed in those days. Even though he spent a lot of his time learning, he \"wasn\\'t able to grasp how music was being made for films.\" However, in 1975 when film producer Panchu Arunachalam was impressed by a song Ilaiyaraaja casually sung, he commissioned him to compose the songs and film score for the Tamil film\\nAnnakili\\n(1976).\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nFor the soundtrack, Ilaiyaraaja applied techniques of modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil\\nfolk poetry\\nand\\nfolk song\\nmelodies. This resulted in creation of a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms. Initially he was little apprehensive about how his work would be received, he thought musicians in the industry may write him off. However, when\\nAnnakili\\nreleased in 1976, the music became a huge hit. For his following 12 films, Ilaiyaraaja based his compositions on the contemporary film music. Later, when a new wave of films started to come, they opened the space for the kind of music he wanted to explore.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja\\'s use of\\nTamil folk music\\nin his film scores injected new life in the Indian film score milieu.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nBy the mid-1980s, he started gaining increasing stature as a composer and music director in the\\nSouth Indian film\\nindustries.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nHe worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as\\nKannadasan\\n,\\nVaali\\n,\\nVairamuthu\\n,\\nO.

The first,\\nHow to Name It?\\n(1986), is dedicated to the Carnatic master\\nTyāgarāja\\nand to\\nJ. S. Bach\\n. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and\\nragas\\nwith Bach\\npartitas\\n,\\nfugues\\nand\\nBaroque\\nmusical textures.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nThe second,\\nNothing But Wind\\n(1988), was performed by flautist\\nHariprasad Chaurasia\\nand a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title—that music is a \"natural phenomenon akin to various forms of air currents\".\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nHe has composed a set of Carnatic\\nkritis\\nwhich were recorded by electric mandolinist\\nU. Srinivas\\nfor the album\\nIlayaraaja\\'s Classicals on the Mandolin\\n(1994). Ilaiyaraaja has also composed albums of religious/\\ndevotional\\nsongs.

Then, it\\'s just me and my harmonium. I just think about the situation and touch my harmonium and music flows. If people consider it as an alternate world, so be it. To me, it is something that I can\\'t explain.\"\\n— Ilaiyaraaja on his creative process\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja, once reflecting over his works after turning seventy-five, said his \"life experiences and learning\" have been the fount from which his musical output poured, but sometimes felt that some of his compositions transcended them as if they were \"the reflection of the efforts of past lives — mine, or those of other musical exponents.\" When enquired if it was mystical as in the case of mathematical genius\\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\\n, who insisted he received math formula in\\ndreams\\nfrom a goddess, Ilaiyaraaja said that unlike Ramanujan who felt a supernatural being guiding him, he always felt a moment of clarity when a composition came to his mind — \"It is as if I am the subject and the object of art at the same time when that happens,\" he said.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nNevertheless, he regards music as a form of spiritual seeking, where one needs to keep their \"inner eye constantly open\", but also assist it with vigorous work, \"In my early years, I would be in the studio till 11 pm. Come home, have bath and dinner, and write music till 2 am. I would wake up by 4, sit down to do my music and be at the studio at sharp 7 am. Music is everything to me. Do you know it took me 27 years to understand the C\\nmajor chord\\non the piano\", he said.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja uses the same\\nharmonium\\n, both in his studio and in concerts. He has scored with it throughout his career. When he was younger, he was never allowed to touch it by his brother who thought he would spoil it. However, Ilaiyaraaja would play with it whenever his brother was not there, \"that\\'s how I learnt how to play,\" he said, \"the harmonium knows that it was made for me. It tells me that there is more music to be made.\"\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nThe harmonium was reportedly bought for eighty-five rupees.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja\\'s musical style is characterised by an orchestration which is a synthesis of\\nIndian folk music\\nand Western classical music, with traditional\\nIndian instruments\\nand\\nmodes\\n. He uses electronic music technology that integrates synthesizers, electric guitars and\\nkeyboards\\n, drum machines, rhythm boxes and\\nMIDI\\nwith large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the\\nveena\\n,\\nvenu\\n,\\nnadaswaram\\n,\\ndholak\\n,\\nmridangam\\nand\\ntabla\\nas well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nWhen asked to explain what his music is, Ilaiyaraaja said, \"How can I explain anything? Everyone’s music is made of their own life experiences. To me music is that which connects human hearts. It is something that takes you to unknown levels.\"\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja speaking after receiving the centenary award at the\\n46th International Film Festival of India\\n(IFFI-2015), in\\nPanaji, Goa\\nOn numerous occasions, Ilaiyaraaja has credited\\nM. S. Viswanathan\\nas an overwhelming influence on his music.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\n\"I could be a music director only by closely watching and listening to the great techniques introduced by M.S. Viswanthan in film music\", he said. Ilaiyaraaja first played the organ for the song\\nMalar Ethu Kankal Than\\nin the film\\nAvalukendru Or Manam\\nfor MSV. He later worked on composing background music for few of his films.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nAlong with M.S. Viswanthan, he called\\nNaushad\\n,\\nRoshan\\n,\\nMadan Mohan\\n, and\\nG.K. Venkatesh\\namong several others, as the \"great masters\".\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nLata Mangeshkar\\nand\\nS. Janaki\\nhad been the singers with whom he experimented his songs relentlessly.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja is nicknamed \"Isaignani\" (the musical sage), a title conferred by Kalaignar Karunanidhi. He is often referred to as \"Maestro\", the title conferred by the\\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra\\n, London.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nHe was one of the earliest Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nThis allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nThe range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by his methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nAccording to musicologist Paul Greene, Ilaiyaraaja\\'s \"deep understanding of so many different styles of music allowed him to create syncretic pieces of music combining very different musical idioms in unified, coherent musical statements\".\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nBy virtue of this variety and his intermingling of Western, Indian folk and\\nCarnatic\\nelements, Ilaiyaraaja\\'s compositions appeal to the Indian rural dweller for its\\nrhythmic\\nfolk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic\\nragas\\n, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nHis sense of visualisation for composing music is always to match up with the movie storyline and help the audience feel the emotions flavoured through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nAlthough he uses a range of complex compositional techniques, he often sketches out the basic melodic ideas for films in a very spontaneous fashion.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nHonours and legacy\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nList of awards and nominations received by Ilaiyaraaja\\nIlaiyaraaja receiving the\\nPadma Vibhushan\\nfrom President\\nRam Nath Kovind\\nIn 2010, Ilaiyaraaja was awarded the\\nPadma Bhushan\\n, the third-highest civilian honour in India and the\\nPadma Vibhushan\\nin 2018, the second-highest\\ncivilian award\\nby the government of\\nIndia\\n.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nOn 6 July 2022, Ilaiyaraaja was nominated to the\\nRajya Sabha\\nas Member of Parliament by the President of India,\\nRam Nath Kovind\\n.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nIn November 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conferred an honorary doctorate to Ilaiyaraaja during the 36th Convocation Ceremony of\\nGandhigram Rural Institute\\nin Tamil Nadu\\'s\\nDindigul\\n.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nIlaiyaraaja has been awarded five\\nNational Film Awards\\n—three for\\nBest Music Direction\\nand two for Best Background Score.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nIn 2012, he received the\\nSangeet Natak Akademi Award\\n, the highest Indian recognition given to practising artists, for his creative and experimental works in the music field.\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nHe is a gold medalist in classical guitar from\\nTrinity College of Music\\n, London.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nIn 2013, when the Indian news channel\\nCNN-IBN\\nconducted a poll commemorating 100 years of Indian cinema, he secured 49% of the people\\'s vote and was adjudged as the country\\'s greatest music composer;\\nA.
